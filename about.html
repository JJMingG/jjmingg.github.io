                        <p>I'm Jamine Guo, but sometimes I go by Jay since it's easier to pronounce. I've lived in Marathon, Florida most of my life and it is where I am based at. Many people find it surprising when I tell them that I was born in Middletown, Ohio, which seems somewhat random. Having been raised in what is considered an island all my life, I am used to small quiet towns as opposed to the city life. Growing up in a small town has its ups and downs. It felt safe growing up here, but there wasn't much to do and very limited opportunities. I had always done well in school, joined many clubs, and was captain of the varsity tennis team.</p>

                        <p>Before going to college, I had no idea what I wanted to do or major in. I have always been a bit computer savvy so I figured why not try computer science. I enrolled to the computer science curriculum at FSU. After my intro to programming course, I became really interested in programming. I thought that it was pretty fun and interesting so I continued my courses in this major. It wasn't until I worked alongside my peers to develop applications like AllTheWage and Last Call, that I knew I wanted to continue my career in software development. I enjoy working and collaborating with others. I love the team atmosphere and bouncing ideas back and forth. The best feeling is when a phase of development is completed and that feeling of accomplishment rushes in.</p>
                        <p>I plan to become a software developer but I am not sure what to specialize in as of yet. Whether it was mobile development or web development, I had enjoyed working on my previous projects. What I'm hoping for is a company that will let me experience many fields and help me grow in my career. Five years down the line, I hope to become a developer capable of leading my own team of developers to create new and amazing products.</p>

                        <p>I made this website with the purpose of letting others know more about me. There were many reasons why I wanted to have a personal website. I wanted some internet presence, an outlet for others to get to know me, a portfolio for recruiters, and a central place for all my content. I figured a portfolio is a great starting point. It's a way to have a base to add on more ideas as I update this website.</p>
                        <p>I intend to keep this website up-to-date as my career grows. I have many features in mind, and more ideas will follow. Future updates will make this website into a more personalized space with content creation, business inquiries, and such. It will all depend on how much free time I have and what my limitations are.</p>

                        <h4>Tennis</h4>
                        <p>I've played tennis ever since I was 7 years old. It is my favorite sport to play and to watch. I was in my high school's varsity tennis team since 7th grade and was captain by the end of my high school career. At one point, I wanted to become a pro after graduating high school. I used to train 5 to 10 hours a day in the blazing heat of the Florida Keys. Unfortunately, coaching and opportunities are limited here and I decided it was not a practical career path. Later on, I joined the tennis club at FSU but ultimately left because there were too many people in the club. I still play tennis for fun whenever I can.</p>

                        <p>I usually go by JMingG in most online games. Hence, the JMG in my brand/logo, as well as its the initials of my 3-part Chinese name. Some of my most consistently played games are League of Legends, Overwatch, and Fortnite. My gaming hobby all began with a game called Maplestory, and the hobby became a staple with League of Legends.</p>

                        <p>Gaming is one of those hobbies that I believe most software developers or computer science majors have. I like to play games when I can afford to have the luxury to spend time playing. I occasionally play single-player games but mainly play online games since I like to communicate with others and there are no set progress benchmarks.</p>

                        <h4>Music</h4>
                        <p>Music is something I have on practically 24/7. Whether it's programming, reading, cooking, or sleeping, I'll always have music playing in the background. I used to play a few instruments as well. I used to play saxophone, piano, and guitar. I unfortunately haven't played an instrument in a long time but lately I've been thinking about picking up an instrument again.</p>

                        <h6>Listening to Music:</h6>
                        <p>I listen to many genres of music ranging from punk rock to pop ballads. Throughout my years of listening to music, I've gone through many phases. I've had a phase where I mainly listened to rock and alternative, a phase for rap, a phase for pop, and now my music mainly consists of K-pop.</p>

                        <p>Recently, I've been interested in composing and producing my own music. Even though I am an amateur, I thought since I've written lyrics before and have a slight musical background, this would be something fun and exciting to do on the side. I have some equipment and mainly use Ableton Live 10 Lite for MiDi, mixing, mastering, and producing.</p>
